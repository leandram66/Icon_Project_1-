<div class="container">
<p>The 9/11 Walk of Remembrance Memorial, held on September 10th, 2023, invited members of the E1/L24 FDNY alongside family and friends to honor the lives of Father Mychal Judge and Detective Steven McDonald lost during the attacks, as well as the many lives affected by the tragic events that took place 22 years ago.</p>

<p>“It’s a needed event and should never be forgotten,” said Irene Venditti. </p>

<p>Venditti and her longtime friend, Freyda Markow, attended the memorial in support of their loved ones lost during the attacks.</p>

<p>“For me, it's healing,” Venditti said in regards to the memorial service. “That's how I heal. But a week before, like her,” Venditti  motioned to Markow, “we're already beginning the journey.” </p>

<p>Markow shakes her head in agreement. “It never ends," laments Markow." I mean, there are days during the course of the year where 9/11 will hit us because we’re still losing so many of our friends and family.”</p>

<p>Markow’s sentiments ring true. Members of the FDNY who survived the attacks are continuing to feel the effects of 9/11 emotionally and physically years later.</p>

<p>A study published  back in 2015 depicts that numerous FDNY members were exposed to harmful chemicals and debris on the day of the attacks. As a result, many are facing long term effects due to the exposure. </p>

<p>According to the Never Forget Project, nearly 14 years after the tragic events, over 7,000 FDNY firefighters and EMTs have received treatment for a 9/11 related injury or illness.</p>
